This file is a melange of ideas aimed towards further development.
If you are interested into Fim internals, philosophy, and evolution, you
are welcome to read this file, and subscribe to the fim-devel mailing list, 
( fbi-improved-devel@nongnu.org ).

If you would like to contribute to Fim, this file could give you ideas or
advice, meanwhile if you would like to contribute with an idea, it could 
contribute to this file, too.

Of course, the BUGS file is a source of constant inspiration (we could say,
of a maniacal taste ) for further work, too.

If you just intend to learn more about Fim, please read the program
documentation in the "doc" directory first along with the man page, of course.

Warning : Stuff in this file could be outdated, but necessary for
ongoing further inspiration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Current development directions

20091220	consider distributing a font file or simply to embed one in the sources, with an eye on portability
20091219	man2html missing fix (for developers)
20091214	consider using libmagic
20091214	and options to wget, for the fimgs script !?
20091124	document comma, period, locales and floating numbers parsing in fim.
20091116	write some miniprogram for debugging keyboard input.
20091017	actually, postscript header can be optional for postscript rendering. shall we introduce forced ps rendering?
20091015	text files reading (via font rendering) plugin :)
20091013	get_commands_list() should sort before returning, or better
		to re-sort these containers after each push/remove
20091010	split CommandConsole.cpp in pieces : it sucks more than 64MB on PDA's while compiing, and thats bad
20091004	pdf picture viewing is memory greedy - be it a leak ?
20091004	scroll amount should be a string. e.g.: "20%","20",".2"
20091004	fim -V should state capability of djvu, ps, pdf, ...
20091004	in book viewing mode (and a single loaded file), typing :N should jump to the N'th inner page : DOCUMENT THIS FEATURE
20091004	PostLoad -> PostFileRead
20091004	should deny sick things as 'alias "n" "n"'
20090917	testing with http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/09/msg00549.html
20090820	should offer EXIF data to fim displaying
20090820	should add a quick sanity check flag ( e.g.: --sanity-check )
20090813	is fim compatible with libjpeg 7 ? write this somewhere
20090810	:|ocr -
20090711	should develop some quick benchmark to evaluate some drawing operations (e.g.: blanking, color fill, etc)
20090603	fix Adobe CS3 created jpg files opening
20090530	        crop        = gTrue; // fix this
20090525	fimgs : should use -o option to rename files to a known filename before loading them, in the temporary directory.
20090525	on ppc64 (gcc40) debian, PAGE_MASK seems marked only for _KERNEL_ in asm/page.h
20090524	http://buildbot.sourceforge.net/PyCon-2003/buildbot.html
20090521	add a THANKS section somewhere
20090513	_seek_magic : if set, this pattern will be searched before going to the next image
		or seek_next {pattern} ?, associando ad Image l'offset .. (a' la multipage)
20090512	a wrapper perl script to find image magic numbers in files
20090512	argument to aliases
20090218	implement a printf() like interface for customizing the status bar information
20090512	need a mechanism to pop all images
20090512	sync the website info with the appropriate README section
20090512	help string support for aliases
20090512 TODO : implement a regexp-based search, to give the user hints. (20090512) (like vim's helpgrep)
20090430	is 'for' inline-documented ?
20090420	rhgb (red hat graphical boot) seems to force an unsupported video format
20090419	once for all, should set an enumeration type for auto scaling policy
20090419	serious exception handling for out of memory conditions for push_back's and stuff
20090418	fimtutor :)
20090412	fbi bugs:
		http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=fbi
20090404	could use dejagnu for interactive (keyboard interaction based) testing
		http://www.kegel.com/xgcc3/ng1.txt, although first tests with expect (http://expect.nist.gov/) showed it
		doesn't handle well input exchange with fim
20090403	should support aa device resizing and character escaping when exchanging data..
20090401	should use aa_getevent
20090318	minicheck to detect wrong permissions on fb file ?!
20090318	static checkers ?
		stllint : aszt.inf.elte.hu/~gsd/s/cikkek/concepts/2006/GregorSchuppSPE05.pdf
		cppcheck : http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppcheck/
		using astyle for code readability ?
		could use flawfinder
20090305	moritz suggests fimgs with :
		src/fim -c 'autoheight=0;autowidth=0;v:auto_scale_v=0;'\
			'autocmd "PostRedisplay" "" "g:oscale=scale;";'\
			'autocmd "PostReload" "" "scale g:oscale.\"%\";";'     *pages*
20090226	debianize:
		dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -k0xEF1258B8
 		fakeroot debian/rules binary

20090224	to test better, develop some simple string functions and f(){}, a=f(x,y) , f , f x y , in vim style if possible, regexp_search
20090223	missing overflow checks
20090223	dput, dupload, svn-autoreleasedeb, devscripts, debsecan
20090223	http://www.cubewano.org/oink <- use this automated checker, as well as other tools, possibily at least for format string vulnerabilities
20090222	high performance compilation flags would be nice now
20090215	more nightly build scripts and automated regression tests with reporting scripts
20090213	rewrite the core in a way to avoid convert_line: there is a potentially big performance gain
20090212	fix problems deriving from missing binaries and stuff
20090112	if there is no convert, fim should notice it.
20090110	write a test case with memory constraints (in a way to stress say, failing mallocs)
20090108	write a test for corrupt image resilience (testing skip functionalities)
20090108	write some multi-mode optimizing blitting code generating m4 macro
20090103	document the PrePrefetch and PostPrefetch autocommand labels
20081230	EXIF editing
20081230	multipage caching and prefetching support still missing
20081230	need of a square angle rotation support
20081229	write a malloc and calloc wrapper, for the future
20081228	marked pictures should have at least some asterisk and the user should be able to unmark them.
20081227	http://www-masu.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kakugawa/TeX-Guy/ for dvi support
20081224	history file should be deconfigurable at compile time and turnable off at invocation
20081224	page flipping should be in but optional
20081221	get rid of designated initializers (-pedantic) for ISO-C++
20081019	consider using docbook for building lots of docs, like in mutt
20080908	pdflib would be a nice try to view pdf files from within fim, but multiple anonymous images should be supported
20080903	introduce a variable for handling centering style : sticky, proportional, smart, ... (see Viewport)
20080826	refine and optimize the rotation mechanism into a smarter, smoother, rendering based one
20080525	see if porting to 16 bits integers is possible (with maybe no image file format library at all)
20080525	maintain a list of existing fim re-implementation and people happing using it
20080509	very long strings in input could cause problems :)
20080508	an autocommand could scale alignment to borders at scale time, too
20080505	on 64 bit architectures, problems arise because pointer arithmetics will return long int's instead of ints
20080504	add an interface to modify key_bindings from within fim
20080504	document and promote the advantages of adaptive 'steps' variable
20080504	the ascale + resize + rotation combination could be messy
20080502	variable=`internal_command` behaviour missing
20080502	reintroduce X custom font support
20080502	enrich the existing commands by documenting them and giving power to their arguments
20080430	add support for probing/scanning in byte ranges in file systems/files for known image types
20080324	absolute priority of removing all extern object references in the code
20080316	i need a class/superclass with the command acception functionality,
		in a way each object would be directly responsible for its own bunch
		of commands.
20080228	to download files from a web page with fimgs
20080219	fill in a spec file for building rpm packages
20080216	resuscitate rotation, inversion and filtering code from fbi
20080127	think about a multi-monitor strategy for a single instance of Fim: note that currently it is possible to specify a framebuffer device (therefore a monitor) via -d (--device)
20080126	time to think about an /etc/fimrc at installation time

20071127	histall, histdell
20071127	fim -q --quiet, vs warning on first run ?
20071127	proposal of a 'cropped view' functionality to ease sequent joint pages reading
20071026	investigate issues related to UTF-8, charset, and mapping stuff vs raw console modes..
20071006	implement mechanisms or policies for namespace inheritage on windows split
20070925	update notices regarding file format compatibilities in the man pages
20070924	a virtual class Context to implement a hierarchical namespace system for variables and maybe functions (to come)
20070920	printing support ? :)
20070903	these features are currently going to be worked in the near future:
			- arbitrary long key sequence bindings (mutt-like)
			- shortcuts algebra for commands
			- parameter passing to commands 
			- variables scoped inside viewport (v:), window (w:), image (i: or l:), global (g:), script (s:)
			- (to study) lookup tables to string to integer token conversion of variable names 
			  (to gain speedup and increase variables impact)
			- (to study) active variables - variables triggering actions
			- vim like 'set', 'let', 'unlet' commands..
20070812	examine fbi's weak points like http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/2203/ and fix them in Fim, if present.
20070812	study the benefits of integration with libraries like:
		DirectFB : for a simpler driver and display mechanism
		SDL : to use X ( 20081018 : enable it at configure time with ./configure --enable-sdl )
		MXK : for fancy input devices and capabilities
		BOOST
		cacalib
		aalib
		libdjvulibre-dev
		...
20070812	integrate the freshmeat-submit script (now seems like the freshmeat api is broken)
20070514	There is a growing need to document the target audience of this
	software and its purposes.
	Then:
	- integrate with external libraries for image analysis (like ANIMAL)
	- integrate with some scripting language (perl, python)
20070417	It has come the time to decide the future developments of Fim.
	A lot of doubts arose. Here they are:
	- integration of the command line completion with the lexer/parser, to gain consistency
	- decisions about the nature of the language:
	  - should the variables be accessed like Bash,Perl, or C?
	  - should strings exist?
	  - should arrays exist ?
	  - should types exist ?
	  - should boolean options exist (like in Vim's paste/nopaste) ?
	  - should multi (quad/..) options exist (like in Mutt) ?
	- could it be nice to attach options set to an image/browser (e.g.: 
	  autowidth in only a window in a multiwindow scenario )?
	- integration with external libraries/scripts/etc.. ?

	These issues need reflection and study of the practical and theoretical
	advantages/possibilities/limitations of the alternatives.
	Meanwhile, the current development effort will be focused on enhancing
	the existing code, possibly not adding features but enhancing the code
	structure and converting the odd Fbi code in elegant, or possibly more
	optimized, (especially the hacked, critical parts concerning mirroring
	and flipping! ) Fim code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major but tricky (time consuming) issues:
20071021	study context-sensitive command completion (so, with pre-parsing.. implying a modified parsing scheme!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor but tricky (time consuming) issues:

20080430	find a way to catch the console signal C-s in fim in a way to make C-s bindable
20080313	make each cpp file include exactly the header files used
20080216	add textureview mode

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor but easy (not time consuming) issues:

20080430	use tmpfile() instead FIM_TMP_FILENAME 
20080414	to use mkstemp() in src/FbiStuff.cpp
20080414	introduce fim_fatal(), fim_warn(), fim_fail(), ...
20080414	use rand48, and more options on random behaviour


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimization related ideas:

20080216	add CFLAGS=-march=pentium4 ... and such optimization checks to the configure script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation related ideas:

20080222	merge documentation for lame users
20080106	add examples/aliases to send emails with attached image from within fim
20080103	create a script to make a fimrc man page from fimrc
20071230	UNIX domain sockets communication and multithreaded Fim
20071230	A decent Features section in the web site, from the top.
20071127	in-depth study of Vim documentation to uniform languages as much as possible
20071127	study autodocumentation issues
20071127	prepare a cookbook
20071127	inspiration : #  vim +':help eval'
20070613	sync documentation, website and the whole with VERSION :)
20070517	automated inline - to txt documentation is a future issue

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost solved problems ideas:

20080127	to detect exactly if running under screen and run accordingly ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language related ideas:

20080502	finish implementing pipe reading of images from inside fim with pread (an interactive -i) : FIM_PIPE_IMAGE_READ
20080502	find a syntactical solution for ;; handling (extra semicolons) in the parser
20080223	fine grain the grammar using whitespaces too
20080216	add a third optional argument to bind : a description
20071127	possible namespaces : 
	 w:... window variables
	 g:... global variables
	 l:... local  variables
	 s:... script variables
	 t:... tab    variables
	 v:... vim    variables 
20071127	functions, return status, stdout, stderr ?
20071025	introduce a namespace : 'e:', to get environment variables!
20070921	argument passing to aliases, bash like ?! or vim-like ? 
20070920	as much as possible of Vim's language intuitive syntax

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debug related ideas:

20080414	follow -Weffc++ g++ flag guidelines, and -Werror
20080414	instead of malloc() to use calloc() and MALLOC_PERTURB, M_PERTURB on mallopt()
20080414	use mtrace() sometimes, MALLOC_TRACE=mout
20080414	use the dmalloc library (DMALLOC_OPTIONS), ElectricFence,
20080414	use valgrind
20080414	use mudflap library
20080414	compile with -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG for having a bug-aware C++ standard library
20080414	experiment with libsegfault, <execinfo.h>
20080414	use lint from time to time
20080414	to add scripts to check for memory leaks and related bugs and build problems,
		in a way contributors could run cron scripts with svn export / build capabilities

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimization:

20070418	Got ~400% speedup on image display thanks to trivial changes in
	the drawing code : memset and memcpy instead of assignations, and a less
	trivial change by swapping RGB channels on loading time instead that on
	drawing time. The analysis was made with the gprof profiler, nicely.

Maybe one day me or some contributor will read 
	http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/ScOut/Publications/PaperInfo/sf05.html
	or
Example 4.14 of the Intel Architecture SW Manual Optimization explains how to
and find some useful idea.
use PSHUFLW,PSHUFW,PSHUFD to reverse contiguous words in registers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
