<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>fim</B>

displays the specified file(s) on the linux console using the
framebuffer device.  jpeg, ppm, gif, tiff, xwd, bmp and png
are supported directly.  
For 'xcf' (Gimp's) images, fim will try to use 'xcftopnm'.
For '.fig' vectorial images, fim will try to use 'fig2dev'.
For '.dia' vectorial images, fim will try to use 'dia'.
For '.svg' vectorial images, fim will try to use 'inkscape'.
For other formats fim will try to use ImageMagick's 'convert'.
<P>
Please note that the full documentation of
<B>fim</B>

is in the FIM.TXT file distributed in the source package.
This man page only describes the
<B>fim</B>

command line switches.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--</B>

<DD>
The arguments before
<B>--</B>

beginning with 
<B>-</B>

will be treated as command line switches.
All arguments after
<B>--</B>

will be treated as filenames regardlessly.
<DT><B>-a, --autozoom</B>

<DD>
Enable autozoom.  fim will automagically pick a reasonable zoom factor when loading a new image. (as in fbi)
<DT><B>-b, --binary[=24|1]</B>

<DD>
Display (any filetype) binary files contents as they were raw 24 or 1 bits per pixel pixelmaps. 
Will pad with zeros.
Regard this as a toy..
<DT><B>-c {commands}, --execute-commands {commands}</B>

<DD>
The <B>commands</B> string will be executed before entering the interactive loop.
Please note that if your commands are more complicated than a simple 'next' or 'pornview'
command, they must be quoted and escaped in a manner suitable for your shell!!
<P>
For example,
-c '*2;2pan_up;display;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+while">while</A>(1){bottom_align;sleep &quot;1&quot; ; top_align}'
<P>
(with the single quotes) will tell fim to first double the displayed image 
size, then pan two times up, then display the image ; and then 
do an endless loop consisting of bottom and top aligning, alternated.
<DT>
<DD>


<B>-d {device}, --device {device}</B>

framebuffer device to use.  Default is the one your vc is mapped to (as in fbi).
<DT><B>--dump-reference-help</B>

<DD>
Will dump to stdout the reference help.
<DT><B>-D, --dump-default-fimrc</B>

<DD>
The default fimrc file (the one hardcoded in the fim executable) is dumped on standard output and fim exits.
<DT><B>-E {scriptfile}, --execute-script {scriptfile}</B>

<DD>
The <B>scriptfile</B> will be executed right after the default initialization file is executed.
<DT><B>-f , --etc-fimrc</B>

<DD>
The /etc/fimrc file will be executed prior to any other configuration file.
If not specified, it is *ignored*.
<DT><B>-F {commands}, --final-commands {commands}</B>

<DD>
The <B>commands</B> string will be executed after exiting the interactive loop
of the program (right before terminating the program).
<DT><B>-h, --help</B>

<DD>
display help and terminate the program.
<DT><B>-i, --image-from-stdin</B>

<DD>
Will read one single image from the standard input (yes: the image, not the filename).
May not work with all supported file formats.
<DT><B>-m {mode}, --mode {mode}</B>

<DD>
name of the video mode to use video mode (must be listed in
/etc/fb.modes).  Default is not to change the video mode.
In the past, the XF86 config file (/etc/X11/XF86Config) used to contain Modeline 
information, which could be fed to the modeline2fb perl script (distributed with fbset).
On many modern xorg based systems, there is no direct way to obtain a fb.modes file from the xorg.conf file.
So instead one could obtain useful fb.modes info by using the (fbmodes (no man page AFAIK)) tool, written by bisqwit.
An unsupported mode should make fim exit with failure.
But it is possible the kernel could trick fim and set a supported mode automatically, thus
ignoring the user set mode.



<DT><B>-N, --no-rc-file</B>

<DD>
No initialization file will be read (default is ~/.fimrc) at startup.
<DT><B>-p, --script-from-stdin</B>

<DD>
Will read commands from stdin prior to entering in interactive mode.
<DT><B>-o {device}, --output-device {device}</B>

<DD>
Will use the specified <B>device</B> as fim video output device, overriding automatic checks.
The available devices depend on the original configuration/compilation options, so you should
get the list of available output devices issuing <B>fim --version</B>.
It will probably be a subset  of {<B>sdl</B>, <B>fb</B>, <B>aa</B>, <B>caca</B>, <B>dumb</B>}.
<DT><B>--offset {offset}</B>

<DD>
Will use the specified <B>offset</B> (in bytes) for opening the specified files (useful for viewing images on damaged file systems).
<DT><B>-P, --text-reading</B>

<DD>
Enable textreading mode.  This has the effect that fim will display
images scaled to the width of the screen, and aligned to the top.
Useful if the images you are watching text pages, all you have to do
to get the next piece of text is to press space (in the default
key configuration, of course).











<DT><B>-s {n}, --scroll {n}</B>

<DD>
set scroll steps in pixels (default is 50).
<DT><B>-S, --sanity-check</B>

<DD>
a quick sanity check before starting fim.
<DT><B>-t, --no-framebuffer</B>

<DD>
Fim will not use the framebuffer but the aalib (ascii art) driver instead (if you are curious, see (info aalib)).
If aalib was not enabled at tompile time, fim will work without displaying images at all.
<DT><B>-T {terminal}, --vt {terminal}</B>

<DD>
The <B>terminal</B> will be used as virtual terminal device file (as in fbi).
See (chvt (1)), (openvt (1)) for more info about this.
Use (con2fb (1)) to map a terminal to a framebuffer device.







<DT><B>-v, --verbose</B>

<DD>
be verbose: show status bar.
<DT><B>-V, --version</B>

<DD>
display version and compile flags, and then terminate.
<DT><B>-w, --autowidth</B>

<DD>
Will adapt the image size to the screen size.
<DT><B>-W {scriptout}, --write-scriptout {scriptout}</B>

<DD>
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file {scriptout}, until you exit Fim.  This is  useful  if  you want to create a script file to be used with &quot;fim -c&quot; or &quot;:exec&quot; (analogous to Vim's -s and &quot;:source!&quot;).  If the {scriptout} file exists, it will be not touched (as in Vim's -w). 
<DT><B>-</B>

<DD>
Reads file list from stdin.
<P>
Note that these the three standard input reading functionalities (-i,-p and -) conflict : if two or more of them occur in fim invocation, fim will exit with an error and warn about the ambiguity.
<P>

<B>EXAMPLES</B>

below to read some useful (and unique) ways of employing fim.

You can visualize all of the default bindings invoking fim --dump-default-fimrc | grep bind .
You can visualize all of the default aliases invoking fim  --dump-default-fimrc | grep alias .

</PRE>

<P>

The Return vs. Space key thing can be used to create a file list while
reviewing the images and use the list for batch processing later on.
<P>
All of the key bindings are reconfigurable; please see the default 
<B>fimrc</B>

file for examples on this, or read the complete manual: the FIM.TXT file
distributed with fim.



















<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AFFECTING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<PRE>
FBFONT          (just like in fbi) a consolefont or a X11 (X Font Server - xfs) font file.
                        For instance,  /usr/share/consolefonts/LatArCyrHeb-08.psfu.gz is a Linux console file.
                        Consult 'man setfont' for your current font paths.
                        NOTE : Currently xfs is disabled.
FBGAMMA         (just like in fbi) gamma correction.
FRAMEBUFFER     (just like in fbi) if set, will override user set framebuffer device file.
TERM            (only in fim: see the default fimrc) will influence the output device selection algorithm, especially if $TERM==&quot;screen&quot;
</PRE><A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMON PROBLEMS</H2>

<B>fim</B>

needs read-write access to the framebuffer devices (/dev/fbN or /dev/fb/N), i.e you (our
your admin) have to make sure fim can open the devices in rw mode.
The IMHO most elegant way is to use pam_console (see
/etc/security/console.perms) to chown the devices to the user logged
in on the console.  Another way is to create some group, chown the
special files to that group and put the users which are allowed to use
the framebuffer device into the group.  You can also make the special
files world writable, but be aware of the security implications this
has.  On a private box it might be fine to handle it this way
through.
<P>
If using udev, you can edit :
/etc/udev/permissions.d/50-udev.permissions
and set these lines like here :
<BR>&nbsp;#&nbsp;fb&nbsp;devices
<BR>&nbsp;fb:root:root:0600
<BR>&nbsp;fb[0-9]*:root:root:0600
<BR>&nbsp;fb/*:root:root:0600
<P>

<P>
<B>fim</B>

also needs access to the linux console (i.e. /dev/ttyN) for sane
console switch handling.  That is obviously no problem for console
logins, but any kind of a pseudo tty (xterm, ssh, screen, ...) will
<B>not</B>

work.
